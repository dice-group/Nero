# Learning Permutation-Invariant Embeddings for Description Logic Concepts

Description logic concept learning deals with learning description logic concepts from a knowledge base and input examples. 
The goal is to learn a concept that covers all positive examples, while not covering any negative examples. 
Here, we accelerate the learning process by NERO--permutation-invariant neural embedding model.

Given a knowledge base, positive and negative examples, NERO learns permutation-invariant embeddings for input sets of examples tailored to-
wards predicting F1 scores of pre-selected description logic concepts. By
ranking such concepts in descending order of predicted scores, a possible
goal concept can be detected within few retrieval operations. 
Importantly, top-ranked concepts can be used to start the search procedure of
state-of-the-art symbolic models in multiple advantageous regions of a
concept space, rather than starting in the most general concept ⊤.

# Testing
We have provided a test script that facilitates testing a pretrained model on different datasets with different learning problems.
```sh
sh test.sh
```
Expected output:

# Embeddings of Description Logic Expressions
Here, we fit a regression model on 2D embeddings of 1-length expressions. 
Despite the information loss incurred due to PCA, embeddings of 1-length expressions have a distinct structure.

# Deployment
To ease using pre-trained model, we provide an API.
```sh
python deploy_demo.py --path_of_experiments "$PWD/Best/NeroFamily"
# Few seconds later, pretrained model is deployed in a local server
Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860/
