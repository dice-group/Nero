# Deep Tunnelling For Expression Learning 

In this work, we propose a novel neurosymbolic that leverage the differentiable computation framework to
tackle the class expression learning problem on structured data.


For a given learning problem, i.e., a set of positive examples $E^+$, 
1. Obtain embeddings in E^+ .
2. Derive two permutation invariant representations from (1).
3. From an input via concatenate these two representations.
4. Predict coverage scores for pre-fixed N number of expressions.
5. Obtain a path from most general expression to the least general expressions via (4).
